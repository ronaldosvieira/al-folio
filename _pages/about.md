I'm a PhD student at the Computer Science department of Universidade Federal of Minas Gerais (UFMG). I received a MSc degree in Computer Science from the same university in 2020, and a BSc degree in Computer Science from Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ) in 2017, with a sandwich period at University of British Columbia (UBC) from 2014 to 2015.

I'm also a member of the [Multidisciplinary Research Lab. on Games (J Lab)](http://www.j.dcc.ufmg.br/){:target="\_blank"} and of the [Vision and Robotics Lab. (VeRLab)](https://www.verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/){:target="\_blank"}, and my research interests include artificial intelligence, games and multiagent systems.
